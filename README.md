# weather-app

This is a weather app that displays the current weather for a given location. It is built using Angular and the OpenWeatherMap API.

**Instructions**

To use this project, simply follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm if they are not already installed on your machine.
2. Install the Angular CLI globally using the command npm install -g @angular/cli.
3. Run the project using the command ng serve -o.

The project will be available at http://localhost:4200.

**Note**

The api key is saved as a variable in the code. In real life, itâ€™s best practice to encrypt API keys and other sensitive information so that they are not exposed in plain text.
